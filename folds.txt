synform
antiform
>direction of folds opening

syncline
anticline
>order of old-young layers going in or out of a fold

z fold vs s folds > need to understand better

kink fold
harmonic fold > symmetrical

cylindrical fold
> all normals to cyclindrical fold fall in a plane
> for perfect c.fold, fold surfaces plotted on a stereonet intersect at one
 point, the hinge line
non-cylindrical
>normal not falling in a plane, ie slightly warped surface

flexural slip/flow
>no distortion of points on original plane that is folded

Orthogonal flexure
>all lines orthogonal to layer remain that way
